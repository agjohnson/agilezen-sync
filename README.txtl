h1. agilezensync

Imports issues from Chili and Github to AgileZen. The sync is
only one way, and only handles creating/updating stories with text, priority,
color, and tags.

This is considered alpha, use at your own risk.

h2. TODO

* Add more resource sources -- Bitbucket, etc
* Add oAuth authentication support to Github
* Add more import properties from tickets
* Add a more verbose CLI script
* Add error handling
